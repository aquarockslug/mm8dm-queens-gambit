Megaman Queen's Gambit, in a world where robots are dumb and have only two toes...

Massive thanks to the 8bdm team for making a extremely fun game that I am able to create a mappack for. 
As well to those in the unoffical 8bdm server for helping me learn how to create this map pack when I 
was at a lost in certain parts of the process and giving really good feedback. Special shout out to those
like Russel and Llamahombre for willing to write a review that helped me out a ton. Lastly but not least, 
thank you to the friends who stuck around and made fun robot masters with me that I was able to now 
realize into a small fan game of sorts through this game as a map pack. Hopefully this is a fun little 
way to immortalize the goobers we made in their own way and for others to experience even if just a little.

Also if you are here just to skip the letter finding to figure out the last two maps, uhhh got your nose!

Feel free to use my custom textures as they are allowed to be used in otherworks outside of the 
pack as long as credit is given to the pack or creator to let people know where they came from. 
However, usage of the Queen BAB prop/sprites and the rift/scrap letters are not up for reuse unless explicit
permission is given by the creator. As it is treated the same as the skins/bots for this pack which
are not allowed to be reused or edited.
