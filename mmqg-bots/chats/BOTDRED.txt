"I can't wait to see the artifacts!"
"Saftey first."
"The excavation crew is in!"

[FragStrings]
"Ah! Im sorry"
"Dig this!"
"Buried!"

[KilledStrings]
"Ive dug a little too deep!"
"Buried alive!"
"Ineffective.."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I'm never going on an excavation expedition with absolute man ever again..."

[RoamingStrings]
"So many interesting ruins to explore and excavate!"
"Why is everyone not careful with the fragile ones!"
"Excavation takes time and patience to get the job done right!"
"Nothing like doing a little extra digging hurts anything!"
"Please be careful with that one!"

[EnragedStrings]
"That is the LAST ONE you break!"
"I'm sealing you in these ruins!"
"I'm breaking this wall down!"

[WinStrings]
"All artifacts recovered and no thanks to me of course!"
"Finally the ruins may rest in peace."

[LoseStrings]
"The ruins... lost to the sands of time."
"Even the artifacts got shattered in the end..."
"The restoration of that artifact was a total failure..."
