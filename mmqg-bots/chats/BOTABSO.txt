"Aboslute Man, Reporting for duty."
"Reporting in, Dr. Cossack."
"I hope this doesn't cut into my workout..."

[FragStrings]
"Focus, idiot."
"You wouldn't last a second out in the arctic wastes."
"Stay down: You'll just hurt the wildlife if you blast around like that."

[KilledStrings]
"Nice shot..."
"This will disrupt my schedule a little bit..."
"If only Tundra Man was as proactive as you..."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I'm quite confident in my body, you know? Huh? Manufactured? You can't manufacture these abs, man."

[RoamingStrings]
"Wildlife: Secure."
"The temps are looking a little high today..."
"This would be a nice spot to work out."
"If I find Tundra around here, I swear..."
"I only accept absolute perfection in my work."

[EnragedStrings]
"I will NOT let you cause anymore disturbances!"
"I suppose I have to do EVERYTHING around here!?!"

[WinStrings]
"Seems like I do have time for my workout."
"Let's hope you take this seriously next time."

[LoseStrings]
"I'm sorry Dr. Cossack... I've failed..."
"I'll never hear the end of this..."
"Guess I won't have time after all..."
